  <h3>Long about me:</h3>
  <p>Hello, friend. Alex here. I am a software engineering graduate living in Stoney Creek, Canada. I graduated magna cum
    laude from <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en">University of Ottawa</a>. I mention this because it means a lot to me.
    I was afraid of the challenges that come with completing an engineering degree curriculum. It took a lot of effort and
    hard work.</p>
  <p>I am interested in all aspects of the software engineering discipline. To prove my dedication beyond obtaining an
    accredited software engineering degree, I am in the process of obtaining my <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering#Canada_2">professional engineering
      (P.Eng) license</a>. I am currently in the <a href="https://peo.on.ca/engineering-intern-program"
      title="The Engineering Intern (EIT) Program">EIT</a> stage. As it is illegal in Canada to call yourself a Software
    Engineer without an engineering license, hopefully this shines some light on any confusion around my <em>Software
      Engineer, <a href="https://peo.on.ca/engineering-intern-program"
        title="The Engineering Intern (EIT) Program">EIT</a></em> title.</p>
  <p>My career path has not been so straightforward.
    The common denominator along all my various career paths has been people. I enjoy helping people and businesses solve
    their problems. I strive to leave whatever I work on in a better state than I found it. My life's goal is to be helpful
    to people by being great at creating and maintaining usable software.</p>
  </p>
  <h3>Other interests:</h3>
  <p>As you know, I also have a degree in Psychology. I went into the degree without any interest and with the single goal
    of
    applying to medical schools. I stayed to learn about people. My honours thesis was <em>&quot;An fMRI investigation of
      working
      memory in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients&quot;</em>. I was interested in Neuroscience and was given an
    opportunity
    to work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">fMRI</a>.</p>
  
  <p>I enjoy knowledge for its own sake. I explore other disciplines to understand our ever-changing world. Also, I use such
  opportunity in attempts to connect different disciplines to software. The future of software lies in cross-disciplinary
  solutions.</p>
  
  <p>I am also interested in business and entrepreneurship. Here is a video of my adventures during the <a
    href="https://www.ontario.ca/business-and-economy/start-summer-company-students">Ontario Summer Company 2014
    Entrepreneurial Grant</a>:</p>
